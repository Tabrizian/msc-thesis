I would like to thank my parents and my dear brother for their amazing
support. Without their support, I would have not been able to survive this
journey. I want to sincerely thank my advisor Professor Alberto Leon-Garcia
for giving me the chance to work independently. His insightful comments have
greatly impacted this project. I want to also thank the Network Architecture
Lab members for insightful discussions and feedback on this project. Also, I
would like to thank Vladi for his great administrative support.
