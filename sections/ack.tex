I would like to thank my parents and my dear brother for their amazing
support. Without their support, I would not been able to do anything. I want
to sincerely thank my advisor Professor Alberto Leon-Garcia for giving me the
ability to work independently. His insightful comments have greatly impacted
this project. I would like to thank Kaveh Mahdaviani and Professor Bianca
Schroeder for their time and insightful discussions.
