\chapter{Scheduler Design}
\label{chap:design}

We designed SC (Scheduling using Co-location) to utilize the excess amount of compute
available in GPUs to reduce the queuing time and job completion time for the deep learning
training jobs in GPU clusters. In \Cref{sec:colocation}, we show empirical results on
how various jobs respond to co-location. In \Cref{sec:colocation-compatible},
we discuss the underlying reason on why some jobs are not compatible with each other.
In \Cref{sec:scheduling-algorithm} we provide the general design and architecture for our
scheduling algorithm.
